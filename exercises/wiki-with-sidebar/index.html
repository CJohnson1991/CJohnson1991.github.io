                <h5>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h5>
                <p>
                    <span-b>Supernatural</span-b> is an American television 
                    series created by <span>Eric Kripke</span>. It was first 
                    broadcast on September 13, 2005, on <span>The WB</span>, 
                    and subsequently became part of successor network 
                    <span>The CW's</span> lineup. Starring 
                    <span>Jared Padalecki</span> as <span>Sam Winchester</span>
                    and <span>Jensen Ackles</span> as 
                    <span>Dean Winchester</span>, the series follows the two 
                    brothers as they hunt <span>demons</span>, 
                    <span>ghosts</span>, <span>monsters</span> and other 
                    supernatural beings. Along with Kripke, the series' 
                    <span>executive producers</span> included <span>McG</span>, 
                    <span>Robert Singer</span>, <span>Phil Sgriccia</span>, 
                    <span>Sera Gamble</span>, <span>Jeremy Carver</span>, 
                    <span>John Shiban</span>, <span>Ben Edlund</span> and 
                    <span>Adam Glass</span>. Former executive producer and 
                    director <span>Kim Manners</span> died during production 
                    of the <span>fourth season</span>.
                    <span><sup>[5]</sup></span> The series was produced by 
                    Kripke Enterprises, <span>Wonderland Sound and Vision</span>
                    , and <span>Warner Bros. Television</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The series was filmed in <span>Vancouver</span>, 
                    <span>British Columbia</span>, and surrounding areas. 
                    It was in development for nearly ten years, as creator 
                    Kripke spent several years unsuccessfully pitching it. 
                    The <span>pilot</span> was viewed by an estimated 5.69 
                    million viewers,<span><sup>[6]</sup></span> and the ratings 
                    of the first four episodes prompted The WB to pick up the 
                    series for a full season. Kripke planned the series for 
                    three seasons but later expanded it to five. The 
                    <span>fifth season</span> concluded the series' main 
                    storyline,<span><sup>[7]</sup></span> and Kripke departed 
                    the series as <span>showrunner</span>.
                    <span><sup>[8]</sup></span> The series continued on for 
                    10 more seasons with new showrunners, including Sera 
                    Gamble, Jeremy Carver, Robert Singer and Andrew Dabb.
                    <span><sup>[9]</sup></span> With its 
                    <span>eleventh season</span>, <span-i>Supernatural</span-i> 
                    became the longest-running American live-action 
                    <span>fantasy</span> TV series.<span><sup>[10]</sup></span> 
                    The series was renewed for a 
                    <span>fifteenth and final season</span> that consisted of 
                    20 episodes,<span><sup>[11][12]</sup></span> and premiered 
                    on October 10, 2019.<span><sup>[13]</sup></span> The 
                    series concluded on November 19, 2020, with 327 episodes 
                    aired.

                <h3>Conception and Creation</h3>
                <p>
                    Before bringing Supernatural to television, creator Eric 
                    Kripke had been developing the series for nearly ten years,
                    <span><sup>[15]</sup></span> having been fascinated with 
                    <span>urban legends</span> since he was a child.
                    <span><sup>[16]</sup></span> He had originally envisioned 
                    <span-i>Supernatural</span-i> as a movie.
                    <span><sup>[17]</sup></span> He later developed it as a 
                    TV series and spent a few years pitching it before it was 
                    picked up by <span>The WB</span>.
                    <span><sup>[18]</sup></span> The concept went through 
                    several phases before becoming the eventual product, 
                    shifting from the original idea of an 
                    <span>anthology</span> series to one of tabloid reporters 
                    driving around the country in a van "fighting the demons 
                    in search of the truth".<span><sup>[16][19]</sup></span> 
                    Kripke wanted it to be a road trip series, feeling that it 
                    was the "best vehicle to tell these stories because it's 
                    pure, stripped down and uniquely American... These stories 
                    exist in these small towns all across the country, and it 
                    just makes so much sense to drive in and out of these 
                    stories."<span><sup>[16]</sup></span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    As he had previously written for The <span>WB</span> 
                    series <span>Tarzan</span>, Kripke was offered the chance 
                    to pitch show ideas to the network and used the 
                    opportunity for Supernatural.<span><sup>[17]</sup></span> 
                    However, the network disliked his tabloid reporter idea, 
                    so Kripke successfully pitched his last-minute idea of the 
                    characters being brothers.<span><sup>[20]</sup></span> 
                    He decided to have the brothers be from 
                    <span>Lawrence</span>, <span>Kansas</span>, because of its 
                    closeness to <span>Stull Cemetery</span>, a location 
                    famous for its urban legends.<span><sup>[21]</sup></span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    When it came time to name the two lead characters, 
                    Kripke decided on "Sal" and "Dean" as an homage to 
                    <span>Jack Kerouac</span>'s road-trip novel 
                    <span>On the Road</span>. However, he felt that "Sal" was 
                    inappropriate for a main character and changed the name to 
                    "Sam".<span><sup>[14]</sup></span> It was originally 
                    intended for the brothers' last name to be "Harrison" as 
                    a nod to actor <span>Harrison Ford</span>, as Kripke 
                    wanted Dean to have the "devil-may-care swagger of 
                    Han Solo". However, there was a Sam Harrison living in 
                    Kansas, so the name had to be changed for legal reasons.
                    <span><sup>[22]</sup></span> Combining his interest in the 
                    <span>Winchester Mystery House</span> and his desire to 
                    give the series the feel of "a modern-day Western", Kripke 
                    settled on the surname of "Winchester". Nonetheless, this 
                    also presented a problem. The first name of Sam and Dean's 
                    father was originally Jack, but there was a Jack 
                    Winchester residing in Kansas, so Kripke was forced to 
                    change the character's name to John.
                    <span><sup>[22]</sup></span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Growing up, Kripke connected to television shows that had 
                    signature cars, such as <span>The Dukes of Hazzard</span> 
                    and <span>Knight Rider</span>. This prompted him to 
                    include one in Supernatural.<span><sup>[23]</sup></span> 
                    "We say it's a modern American Western â€“ two gunslingers 
                    who ride into town, fight the bad guys, kiss the girl and 
                    ride out into the sunset again. And we were always talking 
                    from the very beginning that if you're going to have 
                    cowboys, they need a trusty horse."
                    <span><sup>[23]</sup></span> He originally intended for 
                    the car to be a <span>'65 Mustang</span>, but his neighbor 
                    convinced him to change it to a <span>'67 Impala</span>, 
                    since "you can put a body in the trunk" and because 
                    "you want a car that, when people stop next to it at the 
                    lights, they lock their doors."<span><sup>[14]</sup></span> 
                    Kripke has commented, "It's a <span>Rottweiler</span> of a 
                    car, and I think it adds authenticity for fans of 
                    automobiles because of that, because it's not a pretty 
                    ride. It's an aggressive, muscular car, and I think that's 
                    what people respond to, and why it fits so well into the 
                    tone of our show."<span><sup>[23]</sup></span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kripke had previously pitched the series to Fox executive 
                    Peter Johnson, and when Johnson moved to 
                    <span>Wonderland Sound and Vision</span> as president of 
                    TV, he contacted Kripke.<span><sup>[24]</sup></span> 
                    Johnson soon signed on as co-executive producer, as did 
                    Wonderland owner <span>McG</span> as executive producer, 
                    with the production company set to make the pilot episode. 
                    Before it could be filmed, however, script issues needed 
                    to be dealt with. Originally, the brothers were not raised 
                    by their father, but rather by their aunt and uncle. Thus, 
                    when Dean comes to Sam for assistance in the pilot episode, 
                    he has to convince him that the supernatural exists. 
                    However, Kripke realized that this made the backstory too 
                    complicated and reworked it with Peter Johnson so that 
                    their father raised them to be hunters.
                    <span><sup>[25]</sup></span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The script went through many additional revisions. One of 
                    the original ideas was for Sam's girlfriend 
                    <span>Jessica</span> to be revealed as a demon, which 
                    prompts him to join Dean on the road; however, Kripke 
                    felt it was more appropriate for Sam's motivation to be 
                    Jessica's death, so he had her killed in the same manner 
                    as Sam's <span>mother</span>, making them the "right 
                    bookends".<span><sup>[26]</sup></span> Other revised 
                    concepts include Sam believing Dean to be a serial killer 
                    who murders their father<span><sup>[27]</sup></span> and 
                    their father dying in Jessica's place.
                    <span><sup>[28]</sup></span> Filming for the pilot episode 
                    was greenlit after director David Nutter, who previously 
                    had worked with Kripke on Tarzan, signed on.
                    <span><sup>[29]</sup></span> When the series was 
                    eventually picked up, the studio brought in 
                    <span>Robert Singer</span> as executive producer, as it 
                    wanted Kripke to work with someone with production 
                    experience. Due to his previous work on 
                    <span>The X-Files</span>, co-executive producer 
                    <span>John Shiban</span> was also hired to help design the 
                    series mythology.<span><sup>[30]</sup></span> Kripke had 
                    the series planned out for three seasons but later expanded 
                    it to five<span><sup>[31]</sup></span> and hoped to end 
                    it there on a high note.<span><sup>[32]</sup></span>
