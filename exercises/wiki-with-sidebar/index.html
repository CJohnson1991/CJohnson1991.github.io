                <p>
                    <span-b>Supernatural</span-b> is an American television 
                    series created by <span>Eric Kripke</span>. It was first 
                    broadcast on September 13, 2005, on <span>The WB</span>, 
                    and subsequently became part of successor network 
                    <span>The CW's</span> lineup. Starring 
                    <span>Jared Padalecki</span> as <span>Sam Winchester</span>
                    and <span>Jensen Ackles</span> as 
                    <span>Dean Winchester</span>, the series follows the two 
                    brothers as they hunt <span>demons</span>, 
                    <span>ghosts</span>, <span>monsters</span> and other 
                    supernatural beings. Along with Kripke, the series' 
                    <span>executive producers</span> included <span>McG</span>, 
                    <span>Robert Singer</span>, <span>Phil Sgriccia</span>, 
                    <span>Sera Gamble</span>, <span>Jeremy Carver</span>, 
                    <span>John Shiban</span>, <span>Ben Edlund</span> and 
                    <span>Adam Glass</span>. Former executive producer and 
                    director <span>Kim Manners</span> died during production 
                    of the <span>fourth season</span>.
                    <span><sup>[5]</sup></span> The series was produced by 
                    Kripke Enterprises, <span>Wonderland Sound and Vision</span>
                    , and <span>Warner Bros. Television</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The series was filmed in <span>Vancouver</span>, 
                    <span>British Columbia</span>, and surrounding areas. 
                    It was in development for nearly ten years, as creator 
                    Kripke spent several years unsuccessfully pitching it. 
                    The <span>pilot</span> was viewed by an estimated 5.69 
                    million viewers,<span><sup>[6]</sup></span> and the ratings 
                    of the first four episodes prompted The WB to pick up the 
                    series for a full season. Kripke planned the series for 
                    three seasons but later expanded it to five. The 
                    <span>fifth season</span> concluded the series' main 
                    storyline,<span><sup>[7]</sup></span> and Kripke departed 
                    the series as <span>showrunner</span>.
                    <span><sup>[8]</sup></span> The series continued on for 
                    10 more seasons with new showrunners, including Sera 
                    Gamble, Jeremy Carver, Robert Singer and Andrew Dabb.
                    <span><sup>[9]</sup></span> With its 
                    <span>eleventh season</span>, <span-i>Supernatural</span-i> 
                    became the longest-running American live-action 
                    <span>fantasy</span> TV series.<span><sup>[10]</sup></span> 
                    The series was renewed for a 
                    <span>fifteenth and final season</span> that consisted of 
                    20 episodes,<span><sup>[11][12]</sup></span> and premiered 
                    on October 10, 2019.<span><sup>[13]</sup></span> The 
                    series concluded on November 19, 2020, with 327 episodes 
                    aired.

                <h3>Conception and Creation</h3>
                <p>
                    Before bringing Supernatural to television, creator Eric 
                    Kripke had been developing the series for nearly ten years,
                    <span><sup>[15]</sup></span> having been fascinated with 
                    <span>urban legends</span> since he was a child.
                    <span><sup>[16]</sup></span> He had originally envisioned 
                    <span-i>Supernatural</span-i> as a movie.
                    <span><sup>[17]</sup></span> He later developed it as a 
                    TV series and spent a few years pitching it before it was 
                    picked up by <span>The WB</span>.
                    <span><sup>[18]</sup></span> The concept went through 
                    several phases before becoming the eventual product, 
                    shifting from the original idea of an 
                    <span>anthology</span> series to one of tabloid reporters 
                    driving around the country in a van "fighting the demons 
                    in search of the truth".<span><sup>[16][19]</sup></span> 
                    Kripke wanted it to be a road trip series, feeling that it 
                    was the "best vehicle to tell these stories because it's 
                    pure, stripped down and uniquely American... These stories 
                    exist in these small towns all across the country, and it 
                    just makes so much sense to drive in and out of these 
                    stories."<span><sup>[16]</sup></span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    As he had previously written for The <span>WB</span> 
                    series <span>Tarzan</span>, Kripke was offered the chance 
                    to pitch show ideas to the network and used the 
                    opportunity for Supernatural.<span><sup>[17]</sup></span> 
                    However, the network disliked his tabloid reporter idea, 
                    so Kripke successfully pitched his last-minute idea of the 
                    characters being brothers.<span><sup>[20]</sup></span> 
                    He decided to have the brothers be from 
                    <span>Lawrence</span>, <span>Kansas</span>, because of its 
                    closeness to <span>Stull Cemetery</span>, a location 
                    famous for its urban legends.<span><sup>[21]</sup></span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    When it came time to name the two lead characters, 
                    Kripke decided on "Sal" and "Dean" as an homage to 
                    <span>Jack Kerouac</span>'s road-trip novel 
                    <span>On the Road</span>. However, he felt that "Sal" was 
                    inappropriate for a main character and changed the name to 
                    "Sam".<span><sup>[14]</sup></span> It was originally 
                    intended for the brothers' last name to be "Harrison" as 
                    a nod to actor <span>Harrison Ford</span>, as Kripke 
                    wanted Dean to have the "devil-may-care swagger of 
                    Han Solo". However, there was a Sam Harrison living in 
                    Kansas, so the name had to be changed for legal reasons.
                    <span><sup>[22]</sup></span> Combining his interest in the 
                    <span>Winchester Mystery House</span> and his desire to 
                    give the series the feel of "a modern-day Western", Kripke 
                    settled on the surname of "Winchester". Nonetheless, this 
                    also presented a problem. The first name of Sam and Dean's 
                    father was originally Jack, but there was a Jack 
                    Winchester residing in Kansas, so Kripke was forced to 
                    change the character's name to John.
