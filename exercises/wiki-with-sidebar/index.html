                <h5>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h5>
                <p>
                    <span class="b">Supernatural</span> is an American 
                    television series created by <span>Eric Kripke</span>. 
                    It was first broadcast on September 13, 2005, on 
                    <span>The WB</span>, and subsequently became part of 
                    successor network <span>The CW's</span> lineup. Starring 
                    <span>Jared Padalecki</span> as <span>Sam Winchester</span>
                    and <span>Jensen Ackles</span> as 
                    <span>Dean Winchester</span>, the series follows the two 
                    brothers as they hunt <span>demons</span>, 
                    <span>ghosts</span>, <span>monsters</span> and other 
                    supernatural beings. Along with Kripke, the series' 
                    <span>executive producers</span> included <span>McG</span>, 
                    <span>Robert Singer</span>, <span>Phil Sgriccia</span>, 
                    <span>Sera Gamble</span>, <span>Jeremy Carver</span>, 
                    <span>John Shiban</span>, <span>Ben Edlund</span> and 
                    <span>Adam Glass</span>. Former executive producer and 
                    director <span>Kim Manners</span> died during production 
                    of the <span>fourth season</span>.
                    <span><sup>[5]</sup></span> The series was produced by 
                    Kripke Enterprises, <span>Wonderland Sound and Vision</span>
                    , and <span>Warner Bros. Television</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The series was filmed in <span>Vancouver</span>, 
                    <span>British Columbia</span>, and surrounding areas. 
                    It was in development for nearly ten years, as creator 
                    Kripke spent several years unsuccessfully pitching it. 
                    The <span>pilot</span> was viewed by an estimated 5.69 
                    million viewers,<span><sup>[6]</sup></span> and the ratings 
                    of the first four episodes prompted The WB to pick up the 
                    series for a full season. Kripke planned the series for 
                    three seasons but later expanded it to five. The 
                    <span>fifth season</span> concluded the series' main 
                    storyline,<span><sup>[7]</sup></span> and Kripke departed 
                    the series as <span>showrunner</span>.
                    <span><sup>[8]</sup></span> The series continued on for 
                    10 more seasons with new showrunners, including Sera 
                    Gamble, Jeremy Carver, Robert Singer and Andrew Dabb.
                    <span><sup>[9]</sup></span> With its 
                    <span>eleventh season</span>, 
                    <span class="i">Supernatural</span> 
                    became the longest-running American live-action 
                    <span>fantasy</span> TV series.<span><sup>[10]</sup></span> 
                    The series was renewed for a 
                    <span>fifteenth and final season</span> that consisted of 
                    20 episodes,<span><sup>[11][12]</sup></span> and premiered 
                    on October 10, 2019.<span><sup>[13]</sup></span> The 
                    series concluded on November 19, 2020, with 327 episodes 
                    aired.

                <h2>Production</h2>
                <hr>
                <h3>Conception and Creation</h3>
                <p>
                    Before bringing Supernatural to television, creator Eric 
                    Kripke had been developing the series for nearly ten years,
                    <span><sup>[15]</sup></span> having been fascinated with 
                    <span>urban legends</span> since he was a child.
                    <span><sup>[16]</sup></span> He had originally envisioned 
                    <span class="i">Supernatural</span> as a movie.
                    <span><sup>[17]</sup></span> He later developed it as a 
                    TV series and spent a few years pitching it before it was 
                    picked up by <span>The WB</span>.
                    <span><sup>[18]</sup></span> The concept went through 
                    several phases before becoming the eventual product, 
                    shifting from the original idea of an 
                    <span>anthology</span> series to one of tabloid reporters 
                    driving around the country in a van "fighting the demons 
                    in search of the truth".<span><sup>[16][19]</sup></span> 
                    Kripke wanted it to be a road trip series, feeling that it 
                    was the "best vehicle to tell these stories because it's 
                    pure, stripped down and uniquely American... These stories 
                    exist in these small towns all across the country, and it 
                    just makes so much sense to drive in and out of these 
                    stories."<span><sup>[16]</sup></span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    As he had previously written for The <span>WB</span> 
                    series <span>Tarzan</span>, Kripke was offered the chance 
                    to pitch show ideas to the network and used the 
                    opportunity for Supernatural.<span><sup>[17]</sup></span> 
                    However, the network disliked his tabloid reporter idea, 
                    so Kripke successfully pitched his last-minute idea of the 
                    characters being brothers.<span><sup>[20]</sup></span> 
                    He decided to have the brothers be from 
                    <span>Lawrence</span>, <span>Kansas</span>, because of its 
                    closeness to <span>Stull Cemetery</span>, a location 
                    famous for its urban legends.<span><sup>[21]</sup></span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    When it came time to name the two lead characters, 
                    Kripke decided on "Sal" and "Dean" as an homage to 
                    <span>Jack Kerouac</span>'s road-trip novel 
                    <span>On the Road</span>. However, he felt that "Sal" was 
                    inappropriate for a main character and changed the name to 
                    "Sam".<span><sup>[14]</sup></span> It was originally 
                    intended for the brothers' last name to be "Harrison" as 
                    a nod to actor <span>Harrison Ford</span>, as Kripke 
                    wanted Dean to have the "devil-may-care swagger of 
                    Han Solo". However, there was a Sam Harrison living in 
                    Kansas, so the name had to be changed for legal reasons.
                    <span><sup>[22]</sup></span> Combining his interest in the 
                    <span>Winchester Mystery House</span> and his desire to 
                    give the series the feel of "a modern-day Western", Kripke 
                    settled on the surname of "Winchester". Nonetheless, this 
                    also presented a problem. The first name of Sam and Dean's 
                    father was originally Jack, but there was a Jack 
                    Winchester residing in Kansas, so Kripke was forced to 
                    change the character's name to John.
                    <span><sup>[22]</sup></span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Growing up, Kripke connected to television shows that had 
                    signature cars, such as <span>The Dukes of Hazzard</span> 
                    and <span>Knight Rider</span>. This prompted him to 
                    include one in Supernatural.<span><sup>[23]</sup></span> 
                    "We say it's a modern American Western – two gunslingers 
                    who ride into town, fight the bad guys, kiss the girl and 
                    ride out into the sunset again. And we were always talking 
                    from the very beginning that if you're going to have 
                    cowboys, they need a trusty horse."
                    <span><sup>[23]</sup></span> He originally intended for 
                    the car to be a <span>'65 Mustang</span>, but his neighbor 
                    convinced him to change it to a <span>'67 Impala</span>, 
                    since "you can put a body in the trunk" and because 
                    "you want a car that, when people stop next to it at the 
                    lights, they lock their doors."<span><sup>[14]</sup></span> 
                    Kripke has commented, "It's a <span>Rottweiler</span> of a 
                    car, and I think it adds authenticity for fans of 
                    automobiles because of that, because it's not a pretty 
                    ride. It's an aggressive, muscular car, and I think that's 
                    what people respond to, and why it fits so well into the 
                    tone of our show."<span><sup>[23]</sup></span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kripke had previously pitched the series to Fox executive 
                    Peter Johnson, and when Johnson moved to 
                    <span>Wonderland Sound and Vision</span> as president of 
                    TV, he contacted Kripke.<span><sup>[24]</sup></span> 
                    Johnson soon signed on as co-executive producer, as did 
                    Wonderland owner <span>McG</span> as executive producer, 
                    with the production company set to make the pilot episode. 
                    Before it could be filmed, however, script issues needed 
                    to be dealt with. Originally, the brothers were not raised 
                    by their father, but rather by their aunt and uncle. Thus, 
                    when Dean comes to Sam for assistance in the pilot episode, 
                    he has to convince him that the supernatural exists. 
                    However, Kripke realized that this made the backstory too 
                    complicated and reworked it with Peter Johnson so that 
                    their father raised them to be hunters.
                    <span><sup>[25]</sup></span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The script went through many additional revisions. One of 
                    the original ideas was for Sam's girlfriend 
                    <span>Jessica</span> to be revealed as a demon, which 
                    prompts him to join Dean on the road; however, Kripke 
                    felt it was more appropriate for Sam's motivation to be 
                    Jessica's death, so he had her killed in the same manner 
                    as Sam's <span>mother</span>, making them the "right 
                    bookends".<span><sup>[26]</sup></span> Other revised 
                    concepts include Sam believing Dean to be a serial killer 
                    who murders their father<span><sup>[27]</sup></span> and 
                    their father dying in Jessica's place.
                    <span><sup>[28]</sup></span> Filming for the pilot episode 
                    was greenlit after director David Nutter, who previously 
                    had worked with Kripke on Tarzan, signed on.
                    <span><sup>[29]</sup></span> When the series was 
                    eventually picked up, the studio brought in 
                    <span>Robert Singer</span> as executive producer, as it 
                    wanted Kripke to work with someone with production 
                    experience. Due to his previous work on 
                    <span>The X-Files</span>, co-executive producer 
                    <span>John Shiban</span> was also hired to help design the 
                    series mythology.<span><sup>[30]</sup></span> Kripke had 
                    the series planned out for three seasons but later expanded 
                    it to five<span><sup>[31]</sup></span> and hoped to end 
                    it there on a high note.<span><sup>[32]</sup></span>
                </p>
                <h3>Writing</h3>
                <p>
                    The staff for the first season consisted of Kripke and five 
                    other writers, with assistants to help with researching 
                    urban legends.<span><sup>[17]</sup></span> Most of the work 
                    done in writing the series is very collaborative, with the 
                    writers often breaking up into groups. At the beginning of 
                    each season, the writers are brought together and pitch 
                    their ideas, which are then assigned to a specific writer 
                    to be developed. Each story idea is outlined on a dry-erase 
                    board, with Kripke and Bob Singer making necessary 
                    changes. Afterward, the script is written,
                    <span><sup>[33]</sup></span> and Kripke 
                    goes through it to make sure it has the same tone as other 
                    episodes.<span><sup>[17]</sup></span> Kripke found this task 
                    very difficult to do in the first season,
                    <span><sup>[34]</sup></span> but he felt it became easier by 
                    the third season, as the staff came to "really understand 
                    the show's style".<span><sup>[34]</sup></span> Following 
                    the fifth season, Kripke stepped down as showrunner but 
                    maintained his connection with the series as an executive 
                    consultant. In a 2016 interview with Collider, he 
                    responded to the question as to how involved he still is 
                    with the show with the answer, "I would define myself as a 
                    proud parent who has sent their child off to college."
                    <span><sup>[35]</sup></span> He elaborated on this analogy, 
                    explaining, "I'm there if they need me, I'm happy to help, 
                    but I also stay out of their way if they don't need me."

                <p>
                    The tone of Supernatural was heavily influenced by films 
                    such as <span>Poltergeist</span>—having the horror happen 
                    in a family setting rather than remote location—and 
                    <span>Evil Dead II</span> and 
                    <span>An American Werewolf in London</span>—having bits of 
                    comedy mixed in. Commenting on the former, Kripke said, 
                    "It's the idea that horror can happen in your own 
                    backyard. How many viewers have to worry about the 
                    vampire in the gothic castle?"<span><sup>[14]</sup></span> 
                    "It's always been a show about family."
                    <span><sup>[31]</sup></span> Other influences include 
                    <span>The Two Sisters</span> and Asian horror films 
                    <span>The Eye</span>, <span>Ju-on</span> and 
                    <span>Ring</span>.<span><sup>[36]</sup></span>

                <p>
                    According to creator Eric Kripke, the show originally was 
                    intended to focus on the weekly monsters, with Sam and 
                    Dean Winchester merely being "an engine to get us in and 
                    out of different horror movies every week".
                    <span><sup>[37]</sup></span> His sole desire was to 
                    merely "scare the crap out of people".
                    <span><sup>[38]</sup></span> However, a few episodes in, 
                    Kripke and executive producer Bob Singer noticed the 
                    onscreen chemistry between <span>Jared Padalecki</span> 
                    and <span>Jensen Ackles</span>. This revelation caused 
                    them to change the series to focus more on the brothers 
                    than the monsters, basing the weekly monster around the 
                    storyline they wanted for the Winchesters. According to 
                    Kripke, "Sometimes we don't even have the monster until 
                    way late in the break, once we get all the angst and the 
                    drama done first."<span><sup>[37]</sup></span>

                    The series focuses on the brothers 
                    <span>Dean Winchester</span> and 
                    <span>Sam Winchester</span>, played by 
                    <span>Jensen Ackles</span> and <span>Jared Padalecki</span>
                    , as they travel throughout the country hunting down evil 
                    supernatural creatures. Padalecki became interested in the 
                    role because he liked horror series, including both 
                    <span>The X-Files</span> and <span>The Twilight Zone</span>
                    , which he found similar to the proposed plot of 
                    <span class="i">Supernatural</span>. He was also excited 
                    to play "the reluctant hero", comparing Sam to 
                    <span>The Matrix</span>'s <span>Neo</span> and 
                    <span>Luke Skywalker</span> of <span>Star Wars</span>. 
                    Padalecki had previous experience working with executive 
                    producers <span>McG</span> and David Nutter,
                    <span><sup>[60]</sup></span> 
                    the former convincing him to audition for the role.
                    <span><sup>[61]</sup></span> Ackles was originally asked 
                    by Nutter to audition for the role of Sam
                    <span><sup>[62]</sup></span> but preferred the character 
                    of Dean after reading the script.
                    <span><sup>[63]</sup></span> At the time of his audition, 
                    he was already a series regular on fellow WB series 
                    Smallville. After landing the part of Dean, 
                    his <span>Smallville</span> role was cut short.

                    <span class="i">
                        When I read the script, Dean just jumped 
                        out at me. With that character there was always a bit 
                        more comedy, and a bit more recklessness, and it just 
                        appealed to me more. So when I asked to read for that, 
                        they were like, "That's what we're looking for." 
                        o it was great. I found a character that I really 
                        njoy playing.

                    While the series does not have many lead characters, 
                    there are many recurring characters. 
                    <span>Jeffrey Dean Morgan</span> portrays 
                    <span>John Winchester</span>, father of Sam and 
                    Dean. Making an appearance in the pilot episode, John 
                    does not return until nearly halfway through the first 
                    season, after which he becomes a recurring character 
                    until his eventual death in the second season's 
                    premiere episode, though his spirit returns to help 
                    his sons in the season finale. Later in the series, it 
                    is announced that John Winchester fathered a third son 
                    with another woman; a half-brother to Sam and Dean. 
                    According to writer John Shiban, it was decided early 
                    on that John would die. The writers found that having 
                    the brothers being separated from their father "split 
                    the show". Shiban noted that "... the boys were 
                    looking for Dad, and they were looking for a monster 
                    of the week, whatever that is, whatever case crosses 
                    their path. It became difficult, because we thought 
                    it was like – 'what is Dad doing? Is he doing more 
                    interesting things than the boys are doing, or what?'"
                    <span><sup>[65]</sup></span> They believed Morgan was 
                    initially reluctant about returning to Supernatural 
                    for the second season because of his recurring role 
                    on the series <span>Grey's Anatomy</span>.
                    <span><sup>[66]</sup></span> Future appearances of the 
                    character have been hindered by Morgan's busy schedule.

                    Also introduced in the first season are the demon 
                    <span>Azazel</span> and his 
                    <span>unnamed daughter</span>. While Azazel mainly 
                    appears merely as shadows or silhouettes in the first 
                    season, taking physical form only when he possesses 
                    John Winchester, Azazel's daughter uses a girl named 
                    <span>Meg Masters</span>—portrayed by 
                    <span>Nicki Lynn Aycox</span>—as a host.
                    <span><sup>[68]</sup></span> In the second-season 
                    premiere, Azazel's host is portrayed by Fredric Lehne; 
                    originally brought on for only one episode, Lehne 
                    impressed the showrunners so much that he was asked 
                    to return for the <span>season's two-part finale</span>
                    .<span><sup>[69]</sup></span> Even after the 
                    character's death, Azazel makes appearances in 
                    subsequent seasons, being portrayed by different 
                    actors. Lehne also reprises the role in the first 
                    episode of season six when Dean is poisoned and begins 
                    to see Azazel again. Likewise, after Azazel's daughter 
                    is exorcised from Meg towards the end of the first 
                    season, the demon and her host continued to appear 
                    in the series, although now as two separate 
                    characters. Aycox continued her role in the fourth 
                    season when the angry spirit of Meg tries to kill 
                    the Winchesters. The demon returns for an episode in 
                    the second season played by Padalecki, temporarily 
                    taking Sam as a host. She appears once again in the 
                    fifth season, her newest host being portrayed by 
                    <span>Rachel Miner</span>, in a recurring role.
