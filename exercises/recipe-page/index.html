        <p>
            The only thing better than meatballs is cheesy stuffed meatballs 
            that ooze out ooey gooey mozzarella with every bite! Paired with 
            the creamy “vodka” sauce, this recipe is packed with all sorts of 
            flavors and textures yet it all comes together in a little over 30 
            minutes. It is the definition of an indulgent dinner that can be

        <h1 id="prepping">PREPPING THE MEATBALLS</h1>
        <p>
            Let’s start with the heart of the recipe which is the meatballs! I 
            have been making meatballs this way for years now so when I promise 
            you it is perfection, I mean it. It is packed with so much flavor 
            and they always turn out so juicy. First things first, let’s gather 
            our ingredients. In a small bowl, combine breadcrumbs and milk, 
            letting them mingle for about 5 minutes until perfectly soaked. 
            This mixture acts like a glue to hold the meatballs together. If 
            you want these to be gluten-free, you can always skip this part.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next, in a medium bowl, combine together ground beef, garlic, egg, 
            parsley, Parmesan, and a flavorful array of spices that includes 
            Italian seasoning, salt, black pepper, onion powder, paprika, and 
            red pepper flakes. And now, for the shaping & cheese stuffing!
        </p>
        <p>
            After combining the ingredients in the medium bowl, it’s time to 
            get your hands dirty. You can use gloves if you prefer but I just 
            do it with my hands as is. Take about 2 to 3 tablespoons of the 
            meat mixture and gently roll it between your palms to form a round 
            ball. Once you’ve got a nice round shape, press your thumb into the 
            center to create a little indentation. Now, grab a cube of 
            mozzarella and nestle it snugly into the indentation before sealing 
            the meatball tightly around it. Repeat this process until all the 
            meat mixture is used up. Feel free to experiment with the cheese 
            you use! Since these are Italian-style meatballs, mozzarella does 
            make the most sense but you can also use Monterey Jack. For a spicy 
            version, use pepper jack!
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want to ground turkey or chicken in place of the ground beef,
            that also works as well! Sometimes, I also love adding chopped 
            sun-dried tomatoes and fresh basil to my meatballs for even more 
            flavor, a little secret tip.
        </p>
        <h1 id="crafting">CRAFTING THE VODKA SAUCE</h1>
        <p>
            Now, let’s turn our attention to the star of the show – the luscious
            vodka sauce, or should I say no vodka-vodka sauce since this is an 
            alcohol-free version. Heat up some olive oil in a saucepan over 
            medium heat, then sauté garlic and tomato paste until they reach a 
            rich, caramelized hue. For even more flavor, you can add in some 
            oil from a sun-dried tomato jar which is what I did if you saw the 
            recipe video on Instagram or TikTok. Pour in heavy cream and simmer
            until the sauce thickens to create a creamy consistency. Don’t 
            forget to sprinkle in some parmesan, red pepper flakes, and dried 
            basil for an extra kick.

            <li>
                To a small bowl, add the breadcrumbs and milk. Allow it to soak
                for 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                To a medium bowl, add the soaked breadcrumbs, ground beef, 
                garlic, egg, parsley, parmesan, salt, Italian seasoning, 
                paprika, black pepper, red pepper flakes, and onion powder. 
                Mix together to combine well.
            </li>
            <li>
                Shape the meatballs into round small balls, about 3 
                tablespoons of meat each.
            </li>
            <li>
                Push a small cube of mozzarella into the center of each 
                meatball and roll the meatball to seal it up tightly. Repeat 
                with the rest to stuff them.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Make the Vodka Sauce</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a saucepan, add the olive oil over medium heat. Add the 
                garlic and tomato paste and cook for about 4 to 5 minutes. The
                tomato paste will darken in color from a bright red to reddish 
                brown. This process removes acidity from the tomato paste.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add heavy cream and mix until incorporated. Simmer for about 
                2 to 3 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the red pepper flakes, dried basil, salt, and black pepper 
                to taste. Mix again.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the grated parmesan, and butter. Mix until the sauce is 
                smooth and creamy. Take off the heat and set aside.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Cook the Meatballs</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat a large skillet or pan over medium-high heat. Add a 
                drizzle of olive oil to the pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the meatballs on the pan, spacing them apart. Allow one 
                side to sear, about 2 to 3 minutes, then rotate. Once the 
                other side is browned too, drop the heat to low and allow it 
                to cook through until done, 165 degrees in the center.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer the meatballs to the vodka sauce and serve warm to 
                enjoy!
            </li>
