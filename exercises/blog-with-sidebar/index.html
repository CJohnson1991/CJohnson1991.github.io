                    <h3>Season 1</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        The first season starts off as the brothers begin 
                        searching for their father, John Winchester. For 
                        several episodes, Sam and Dean Winchester receive 
                        contacts and travel around the USA looking for John. 
                        The series begins with the death of their mother, 
                        Mary Winchester, at the hands of the demon with Sam 
                        (as a baby) as a witness, and their lives as hunters 
                        in search of the demon that killed their mother.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        22 years after Mary's death, Sam now goes to college 
                        and lives with his girlfriend, Jessica Moore, but at 
                        one point Dean shows up to tell him their father has 
                        gone missing. Sam hesitantly goes on the hunt with 
                        Dean, and their first encounter is with a ghost. After 
                        that, Dean and Sam return to find that Jessica has 
                        been killed by the Yellow-Eyed Demon. Sam travels with 
                        Dean in order to get revenge for his girlfriend and 
                        his mother and travels with Dean to get back, at the 
                        same time searching for their father. On the way, they 
                        face ghosts, shapeshifters, Wendigos and other 
                        creatures such as vampires and demons. They also meet 
                        new people, while introducing the audience to Bobby 
                        Singer. Sam is also revealed as we learn of his past, 
                        as he meets someone who has special powers like him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The season ends with Sam and Dean finding their 
                        father, but only to lose him again as he is captured. 
                        Dean and Sam eventually find him, but he is revealed 
                        to be possessed by Yellow-Eyes, who injures Dean very 
                        badly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yellow-Eyes then tells Sam of his intention to what he 
                        wants with him. Sam shoots John in the leg with the 
                        Colt, where he rushes both John and Dean to the 
                        hospital, only to crash into a truck driven by a 
                        possessed driver., thus ending Season 1.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Season 2</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        The second season revolves around Dean and Sam 
                        searching for the Demon, Yellow-Eyes. The second 
                        season picks up where the first season left off. As 
                        Dean is in a coma and dying, John Winchester sells his 
                        soul to the Demon in order to save Dean's life. The 
                        Impala is also destroyed. When John dies, Dean 
                        promises something to him. Dean and Sam stay in 
                        contact with Bobby, all while meeting new characters 
                        such as Ash, Ellen, and Jo Harvelle, who lives in a 
                        roadhouse. Jo and Ellen have also lost someone, who 
                        was partners with John Winchester. Dean and Sam 
                        encounter new creatures, such as zombies, werewolves, 
                        the Croatoan Virus, hellhounds, crossroad demons, and 
                        old enemies, such as ghosts and vampires and demons. 
                        The Winchester Brothers also frequently get into 
                        trouble with the law now, as indicated to an accident 
                        in the previous season. The season ends with the 
                        roadhouse being destroyed, Ash being killed, Ellen and 
                        Jo missing and yellow-eyes capturing Sam. Sam and 
                        other special children battle it out to stay alive, 
                        but only one of them can survive. Many are killed, 
                        as there is a traitor in the midst.

                    <p>
                        The penultimate episode ends with Sam being killed and 
                        the finale begins with Dean selling his soul to a 
                        crossroads demon. Dean is given one year to live, as 
                        Sam is brought back to life. They travel to a 
                        graveyard, where one of the special children opens the 
                        gates of Hell. Bobby and Ellen team up with Sam and 
                        Dean to fight yellow-eyes and Dean kills the demon 
                        with the Colt, with some assistance from their father's 
                        spirit. As a consequence, dozens of demons escape. The 
                        season finale ends with Sam and Dean setting out to 
                        stop them, as well as breaking the contract that Dean 
                        had with the demon.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Season 3</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        This season is about Sam and Dean trying to break the 
                        deal that Dean made the season finale prior to this 
                        season. They set out to find the demon in charge of 
                        Dean's contract. Sam and Dean encounter numerous 
                        demons that have escaped, due to the gates of hell 
                        being pulled open. Dean is having the time of his 
                        life, as he has one year left to live. The brothers 
                        meet an old foe and make a new one by the name of 
                        Bela Talbot. They also make a new ally known as Ruby, 
                        who is a demon. The brothers encounter several foes 
                        and are hunted down by the law until they are declared 
                        dead halfway through the season. Specials include a 
                        Christmas special, and a special involving Bobby. 
                        Another episode revolves around Dean as the brothers 
                        attempt to stop some changelings, while Dean meets a 
                        former lover known as Lisa Braeden with whom he had a 
                        one-night stand. ("You think it's so easy doing 
                        one-night stands... well try playing in a rock 'n roll 
                        band!") The new foe, Bela Talbot proves worthy as she 
                        can steal supernatural objects, such as the Colt from 
                        the brothers. They attempt to track her down in order 
                        to get the Colt back but realize a dark secret about 
                        her. She has a contract with a demon as well, and 
                        reveals the name of the demon in charge, just before 
                        being killed off-screen by a pack of hellhounds. The 
                        season finale focuses on Dean's time nearly being up, 
                        as they track down Lilith, with Bobby helping them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As they close in on her, they discover she has taken 
                        Ruby's original form, and Dean's time is up, with 
                        Lilith letting the hellhound in the room, as it 
                        forwards on Dean and mauls him to death. A distraught 
                        Sam watches from close up, and as Lilith is about to 
                        kill him, she soon discovers that he is immune to her 
                        powers, due to his abilities. Lilith flees, and Sam 
                        cradles Dean's lifeless body. The scene ends with Dean 
                        calling out for Sam, and then cuts to black.

                    <h3>Season 4</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        Season 4 starts off with Dean being mysteriously pulled 
                        out of Hell by an unseen force. Dean has been gone for 
                        four months and visits Sam and Bobby, who are also 
                        puzzled by his sudden resurrection. Dean, Sam and 
                        Bobby attempt to find what pulled him out, and enlist 
                        the help of a psychic known as Pamela Barnes. they 
                        managed to discover the name of the being, known as 
                        Castiel, but this comes at a price. The sight of 
                        Castiel burns Pamela's eyes out. The brothers attempt 
                        to find the being, which is then known that he is an 
                        angel. The brothers discover that he pulled Dean out 
                        of Hell, as God has work for him. We also see that 
                        something has happened to Sam in the past few months, 
                        as his abilities grow stronger, which means he can now 
                        exorcise demons. Dean and Sam face old enemies, as 
                        well as new ones, and make new friends such as Pamela 
                        and Chuck Shurley, a prophet for God. Dean and Sam 
                        continue their hunt for Lilith, as Castiel tells them 
                        she plans to open the 66 Seals to let Lucifer out of 
                        Hell. Dean confronts Sam of his actions after 
                        discovering what he has done and discovers that Ruby 
                        is back in a different body. In the middle of the 
                        season, Sam and Dean locate a woman who hears the 
                        angels speak, but later discover that she is also an 
                        angel. The angels plan to kill her, but Sam and Dean 
                        want to help her. Deans discovers that Sam has been 
                        drinking demon blood, which makes him stronger. Sam is 
                        locked in Bobby's panic room, and Dean is also 
                        confronted by a demon, whom he later kills.

                        The season finale starts with Sam leaving Dean to kill 
                        Lilith with Ruby, and Dean trying to find and stop him, 
                        but Dean is kidnapped by the angels and is told that 
                        The Apocalypse must not be prevented, as it will 
                        cleanse the earth. Sam and Ruby locate Lilith, and Sam 
                        kills her until Ruby reveals that Lilith's death is 
                        the final seal. Azazel's intentions are finally 
                        revealed, as he was to have a special child that would
                        open Lucifer's prison and become Lucifer's vessel. 
                        Ruby betrays Sam and tells him that she was working 
                        for Lilith all along, and Lilith was the only one who 
                        knew. Dean appears and kills Ruby with her own knife, 
                        and the doors close as Lucifer's prison opens.

                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        This season picks up where the last one left off. Dean 
                        and Sam reconcile as the prison opens, and prepare to 
                        die, but they are soon pulled out onto a plane. Sam 
                        and Dean encounter Chuck who tells them that Castiel 
                        has been blown to pieces. They re-encounter an old 
                        enemy, known as Meg Masters from season 1, who 
                        threatens them, and Bobby is with them, as he is 
                        possessed. Bobby saves Sam and Dean by stabbing 
                        himself. During the first episode, it is revealed 
                        that there is a weapon that can stop the Apocalypse, 
                        Micheals sword. But soon the Zachariah reveals that 
                        Dean is the vessel to the Michael the Archangel. 
                        Castiel appears, revived and stops Zachariah. 
                        Meanwhile, a man whose family has been killed is 
                        stalked by Lucifer, who wants to use the man as a 
                        vessel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During this season Dean and Sam encounter the Four 
                        Horsemen of the Apocalypse- War, Famine, Pestilence, 
                        and Death. During season 5, for two episodes, Sam and 
                        Dean part ways, only to be back together after Dean is 
                        transported to the future where he learns that the 
                        world is in ruins and Sam has given into Lucifer's 
                        demands, essentially resulting in Lucifer himself 
                        possessing Sam's body.

                    <p>
                        Sam also discovers that he is Lucifer's true vessel, 
                        and Sam and Dean set out to stop Lucifer and Michael, 
                        and both agree they won't be vessels. Sam and Dean 
                        encounter new enemies, such as new angels, and 
                        witches, as well as ghosts. During the season, Dean 
                        and Sam are killed and sent to Heaven, and they 
                        encounter their half-brother for a second time, who 
                        is Michael's new vessel. Sam and Dean successfully 
                        get the horsemen's rings, after a third meeting with 
                        the Trickster, now known as the Archangel Gabriel. 
                        The brothers then agree that Sam says yes so he can 
                        get close enough to trap Lucifer in Hell, although 
                        Sam will be trapped forever as well. The season finale 
                        focuses on Sam saying yes to Lucifer, so they can 
                        trick him into the portal, Although Lucifer tricks 
                        them and hides the rings. Chuck tells the story of 
                        the Impala and the adventures with Sam and Dean. 
                        Sam is possessed by Lucifer, and Adam is possessed by 
                        Michael. They begin to fight in the graveyard until 
                        Dean intervenes with Castiel and Bobby. Castiel 
                        temporarily forces Michael away with a holy fire 
                        molotov, and an angry Lucifer kills him. Lucifer beats 
                        Dean, badly injuring him, but Bobby shoots at him 
                        with a gun. Lucifer snaps his neck, and as Lucifer is 
                        about to hit Dean again, he remembers the toy soldier 
                        in the Impala. Michael reappears, and Sam gains 
                        consciousness and traps he, Lucifer, Michael and Adam 
                        into the pit, which closes up. Dean is distraught, and 
                        Castiel reappears, healing Dean and reviving Bobby, 
                        thanks to God reviving him again. Dean and Bobby 
                        depart, and Dean travels to Lisa's house, where he 
                        sits with them to have dinner. Chuck disappears into 
                        thin air mysteriously. As a distraught Dean sits down 
                        to dinner with Lisa and Ben, Sam watches from outside, 
                        as a lamp post flickers out, implying if he is Sam or 
                        Lucifer.

                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        This season is set a year after season 5. This season 
                        starts with Dean living with Lisa and Ben and lives a 
                        normal life. He no longer uses his Impala, and no 
                        longer hunts demons or other creatures. Dean is 
                        poisoned by a Djinn, after hallucinating about Azazel. 
                        Sam saves Dean from his poison, and Dean wakes up in a 
                        dark room. Sam is now living a full hunter life. After 
                        a brief meeting with his maternal family, the 
                        Campbells, including his grandfather, Samuel Campbell. 
                        Dean does join Sam eventually, and Castiel comes 
                        shortly after. Dean begins to notice Sam acting 
                        differently, and they eventually find out that Sam 
                        doesn't have a soul. His soul is in the cage with 
                        Lucifer and Michael. So they begin to hunt for Sam's 
                        soul, and Crowley comes along and tells them that he 
                        is responsible for bringing Sam back. With this, they 
                        begin to work for Crowley, until they confront him 
                        and Castiel burns his bones. Dean later makes a deal 
                        with death to get Sam's soul back, and this sends Sam 
                        into a week-long coma. When he wakes up, he doesn't 
                        remember what happened when he was soulless. He does 
                        find out about it from Castiel. After that Dean is 
                        forced to break ties with Lisa and Ben, and Sam 
                        remembers a bit of hell. Not to mention Balthazar, 
                        the rogue angel sends them into an alternative 
                        reality. Later on, they face the Mother of All, and 
                        Dean defeats her after she reveals that Crowley is 
                        alive. So they begin to look for Crowley, only to 
                        find out that Castiel is working with him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then Crowley kidnaps Ben and Lisa in order to make 
                        Dean stop. Dean goes out of his mind looking for them 
                        and thanks to Balthazar, he finds them. When he gets 
                        there, he finds Lisa possessed by a demon and is 
                        forced to exorcise it despite it injuring her body. 
                        Unable to put them into any danger, Dean asks Castiel 
                        to erase Lisa and Ben's memory of him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Castiel does the unthinkable and breaks down Sam's 
                        wall inside his head in order to distract Dean. While 
                        Sam does battle in his head, Castiel betrays Crowley 
                        and Balthazar brings Dean Castiel's location. 
                        Unfortunately, Castiel, having discovered that 
                        Balthazar has betrayed soon kills his former friend 
                        with an angel blade.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So Dean and Bobby head to Castiel's location with Sam 
                        later joining them, only for them to discover a 
                        shocking and horrifying truth: Castiel is now the new 
                        God.

                    <h3>Season 7</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        After declaring himself God, Castiel goes forth to try 
                        and punish all the wrongdoers in the world, garnering 
                        attention. Very quickly though, he discovers that he 
                        had absorbed Leviathan as well who are breaking free. 
                        Sam and Dean manage to return the Purgatory souls but 
                        fail to return the Leviathans who seemingly kill 
                        Castiel before vanishing. The Leviathans inhabit the 
                        bodies of many different people around the world, with 
                        Sam and Dean learning their weakness Borax, though it 
                        has minimum effectiveness on the Leviathan leader, 
                        Dick Roman. After Roman kills Bobby, Dean becomes 
                        obsessed with taking the Leviathans down and learns of 
                        a facility they are making, only to learn it is a 
                        facility to cure cancer as one Leviathan puts it: 
                        "We're only here to help". The spirit of Bobby later 
                        confirms that while they are curing disease, they are 
                        doing it as part of their grand plan to turn humanity 
                        into the perfect food source. With the help of 
                        Castiel, the brothers learn that the only way to 
                        kill the Leviathans is with the "bone of a righteous 
                        mortal washed in the three bloods of the fallen" and 
                        set out to find those three bloods. Eventually, Dean 
                        and Castiel kill Dick but are dragged into Purgatory 
                        as a result while Sam is left alone to deal with 
                        Crowley, who plans to rise to power now that the 
                        Leviathans are disorganized.

                    <p>
                        Key plot points presented in the season were Sam 
                        struggling with the constant hallucinations of Lucifer 
                        and the ghost of Bobby "haunting" Sam and Dean through 
                        his alcohol flask. Bobby's rage towards Dick Roman 
                        slowly causes him to become a vengeful spirit, and 
                        Sam and Dean trying to deal with this fact ultimately 
                        leads them to burn his flask at his request, 
                        destroying Bobby.

                    <h3>Season 8</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        The ferocious beasts, called the Leviathans, are 
                        effectively apprehended, by the team effort of the 
                        Winchesters, Castiel, and Meg, by the death of their 
                        leader, Dick Roman. Dick, God's first Leviathan, is 
                        killed by Dean, with the Bone of a Righteous Mortal 
                        Washed in the Three Bloods of the Fallen, the only 
                        implement in existence that can slay the Leviathan. 
                        The "kick" of the weapon, as Crowley calls it, sends 
                        Dean and Castiel to Purgatory - the realm where 
                        monsters prey on each other for eternity. There, Dean 
                        and Castiel team up with a vampire named Benny, and 
                        the three seek a portal, which can be accessed by 
                        humans, as a way out.

                    <p>
                        Much of the season involved the Hell Trials. These 
                        trials were designed by God to close the gates of Hell 
                        forever. These included: 
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Killing a Hellhound.</li>
                        <li>Freeing an innocent soul from Hell.</li>
                        <li>Curing a demon.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        The first two were successfully completed by Sam and 
                        the third was almost to be done when Sam was stopped 
                        by Dean. It seemed that the Scribe, Metatron failed to 
                        mention that Sam would die if he completed the third 
                        trial.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Meanwhile, Castiel became an unwilling pawn in the 
                        hands of Metatron. Castiel thought that completing the 
                        Heaven trials would lock the angels in Heaven and 
                        prevent their power struggle from reaching Earth. 
                        Instead, Metatron banished every angel (except himself) 
                        to Earth, to live as humans.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is for the first time, the brothers let monsters 
                        live, believing them to be capable of change, just like 
                        humans. Benny, a vampire and Kate, a werewolf were 
                        spared the brothers' wrath. Unfortunately, Benny had to 
                        be killed to save Sam in Purgatory.

                    <p>
                        Angels are on Earth, having fallen from Heaven in the 
                        last season by Metatron's evil schemes. Angels are 
                        amassing and possessing hosts. Meanwhile, the demon 
                        Abaddon breaks out of Hell and possesses numerous 
                        militia with her demons, and starts a war against 
                        Heaven and Earth. The angels are warring against each 
                        other, having had their wings burned off in their 
                        falls, and are unsure of what to do or who to follow. 
                        Metatron appears to Castiel and other angels, sending 
                        angelic hitmen after the brothers. Sam is tricked by 
                        Dean into letting the angel Gadreel possess him, in 
                        the hopes that Gadreel will heal Sam's internal wounds 
                        caused by the Trials. Meanwhile, Dean and Crowley 
                        track down Cain, who gives Dean his mark. Dean then 
                        tracks down the First Blade, which is the only weapon 
                        capable of killing Abaddon. Dean is later stabbed to 
                        death while fighting Metatron, but the Mark of Cain 
                        revives him as a Knight of Hell. They also manage to 
                        find a way to open Heaven again for the angels - for 
                        the Cube of Metatron which opens a portal to Heaven 
                        even when sealed. On Earth, Metatron is becoming far 
                        more arrogant and believes he is God. He says he will 
                        be called "X". Metatron goes around healing people and 
                        performing "miracles" to "prove" he is God. He 
                        converts an angelic faction, but Castiel fights him 
                        and tricks him into admitting his desires to enslave 
                        all angels which every single angel on Earth hears, 
                        and they run towards Metatron and shackle him in anger. 
                        Castiel imprisons Metatron in Heaven's dungeon, and 
                        temporary order is restored to Heaven. They also manage 
                        to find a way to open Heaven again for the angels - 
                        for the Cube of Metatron which opens a portal to Heaven 
                        even when sealed.

                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        Dean is with Crowley and Crowley suggests they take 
                        over Hell and revamp it to Crowley's desires. However, 
                        Dean is not happy to be bossed about by the King of 
                        Hell and he suggests that they stop making deals with 
                        human clients. Crowley is always humiliated by Dean, 
                        and Crowley keeps getting threatening phone calls from 
                        Sam, who says he'll avenge Dean and kill Crowley. 
                        Finally confronting the demonic Dean, Sam tries to 
                        reason with his monstrous brother but Dean refuses to 
                        make any contact. Sam and Castiel team up to cure 
                        Dean, which is successful. Dean learns Cain is on a 
                        murder spree, his first demon killing in season 9 in a 
                        hundred years bought up a lust for violence. Cain 
                        fights with Dean, and eventually, Dean disarms Cain 
                        (literally) and kills him. Dean and Sam fight many
                        more monsters, such as the goddess Calliope, who is 
                        attracted to a school show of Chuck's Supernatural 
                        books. Castiel gets his grace back, Metatron becomes 
                        human, Charlie finds the book of the damned, and Sam 
                        goes behind Dean's back to remove Mark of Cain, 
                        unintentionally releasing the Darkness, and Dean kills 
                        Death.

                    <h3>Season 11</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        Following the release of the Darkness, the season 
                        follows the Winchesters and their allies as they find 
                        themselves fighting the most powerful supernatural 
                        entity they have ever faced, unlike anything else they 
                        have ever gone up against before.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Immediately after its release, and tipping over the 
                        Impala, Sam sees that Dean is gone and goes to look 
                        for him, finding him in a field where Dean had a 
                        conversation with the Darkness, which apparently turns 
                        out to be, or at least, takes the form of a woman in a 
                        black dress. Dean says that she thanked him for 
                        setting her free.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Meanwhile, Castiel is still suffering from the dog 
                        attack spell the witch Rowena put him under and starts 
                        to attack others. He also remembers that when he 
                        attacked Crowley, the King of Hell escaped from his 
                        current vessel and into another one. He then orders 
                        his demon minions to get rid of the spell holding his 
                        vessel in place.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As Sam and Dean drive away from the old diner, they 
                        find a Sheriff's deputy named Jenna Nickerson and head 
                        to a hospital to help others. Upon arriving there, 
                        they find people with black veins which Sam calls 
                        Rabids, people who have been forced to let their inner 
                        darkness out. This being an effect of the release of 
                        the Darkness. They also find a human baby in the mix 
                        named Amara. Meanwhile, as a manhunt for him begins, 
                        Castiel prays to the angels, begging them to help him 
                        from hurting others and is willing to take whatever 
                        punishment they bring him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As Dean, Jenna, and the baby make it out of the 
                        hospital, Sam using himself as a diversion gets 
                        infected and starts to sprout black veins. Eventually, 
                        after he prays to God for help, he encounters a reaper 
                        named Billie who is apparently disappointed that Death 
                        is dead and says that the next time Sam and Dean are 
                        killed, she will ensure that they stay dead and even 
                        that she will toss them into the Empty, a place no 
                        soul nor entity nor being can escape from. As the 
                        angels find Cass, they start to torture him and after 
                        Hannah arrives, she explains that alarms are going off 
                        in Heaven. He implies that those alarms are for the 
                        release of the Darkness. As the tortures continue, 
                        Castiel escapes and Hannah dies trying to save him. 
                        Crowley manages to get back in his vessel and his 
                        subordinates reveal that the Darkness is free, 
                        especially that when Michael and Lucifer themselves 
                        apparently shouted throughout Hell from the Cage.

                    <p>
                        Dean and Jenna go to her grandmother's house and when 
                        they realize Amara is levitating objects, she calls 
                        Dean and her grandmother calls an exorcist, who turns
                        out to be Crowley impersonating a priest. However, back 
                        at the hospital, Sam finds a cure for the "Rabids": 
                        Holy Fire. And he makes a ring of holy fire and cures 
                        a few others as well. The baby turns out to be Amara 
                        as a child as Dean finds the Mark of Cain on her. 
                        Amara sucks out Jenna's soul and she becomes soulless, 
                        like how Sam once was. After Crowley kills Jenna, Dean 
                        attacks him as he plans to take the baby, but fails as 
                        the baby walks out and quickly grows up. Sam and Dean 
                        eventually reunite and find Cass at the bunker, while 
                        Crowley finds Amara and takes her to Hell as an 
                        offering.

                    <p>
                        The Winchesters look for ways to find and stop the 
                        Darkness, but first, they search for Rowena to undo 
                        the spell on Cass. They find her and she does so, but 
                        she escapes. At Crowley's Lair, Crowley becomes 
                        Amara's "uncle" and her appetite grows and she starts 
                        to feed on demons. Eventually, Sam reveals to Dean 
                        that he has been having visions about a being he 
                        describes as the opposite of the Darkness, which he 
                        thinks is God himself.4
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While Sam and Dean work on ordinary cases involving 
                        ghosts, monsters, and even along the way Imaginary 
                        Friends, the brothers, and Cass also start searching 
                        for ways to defeat the Darkness. Even after finding 
                        Amara where Crowley is keeping her, Dean doesn't 
                        appear to strike at her and he fails and she escapes. 
                        Meanwhile, at the place, Sam's visions start to become 
                        more revealing, as he starts to have visions of 
                        Lucifer's Cage. Castiel eventually finds Metatron, 
                        who has started a business of catching what he calls 
                        reality but is also miserable about his current 
                        tatus. After beating and throwing him, Castiel asks
                        Metatron what he knows about the Darkness, considering 
                        he was God's scribe. Metatron reveals that in order to 
                        create the Earth, Heaven, even the entire Universe, in 
                        order to start creation itself for that matter, 
                        God didn't only imprison the Darkness, but he had to 
                        betray and sacrifice her and Metatron says that the 
                        Darkness is the only thing God's really ever known, 
                        his only kin... his older sister.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although Dean hates the idea, they intend to go the 
                        Limbo, the deepest place in Hell, and speak to Lucifer 
                        about the Darkness. They enlist the help of Rowena to 
                        summon him. And when Dean goes to find Amara at a 
                        church where she attacks people, Sam awaits outside of 
                        a supernatural cage in Limbo surrounded by powerful 
                        fire and covered in enochian sigils, and eventually, 
                        Lucifer himself appears in the cage, manifested as his
                        original vessel, Nick. He and Sam talk about the 
                        Darkness and how to stop her while Amara and Dean talk 
                        about her issue with her brother. After three angels 
                        find her and try to attack her, she kills them all and 
                        summons a powerful smiting attack that knocks her out. 
                        In Hell, Lucifer says that he will help them stop her, 
                        but only if he possesses Sam and returns to Earth. Sam 
                        says no and Lucifer extinguishes the fire, erases the 
                        warding, and summons Sam in the cage and still tries 
                        to make him say yes, especially when he reveals that 
                        it wasn't God who sent Sam the visions, but it was 
                        Lucifer. When the Darkness was set free, it damaged 
                        the cage and allowed Lucifer to reach out to Sam. 
                        Though Sam strongly considers, he still says no and 
                        Lucifer starts to attack him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rowena reveals that Lucifer came to her in a dream and 
                        said he needed her help to get Sam to him and she 
                        would join him. But, after Cass finds Amara, having 
                        survived the attack, she summons him to Dean with a 
                        message and eventually, as Rowena conjures the spell 
                        to banish Lucifer, Dean and Cass head down to the cage 
                        and help Sam survive in a fight against Lucifer. As 
                        Lucifer also kills Cass, Lucifer is banished by 
                        Rowena. After leaving Hell, Cass apparently stays and 
                        reveals the before Lucifer could be banished back to 
                        the Cage, Cass said yes to him and Lucifer possessed 
                        him. After freeing and then killing Rowena, Lucifer 
                        takes back Hell and makes Crowley his slave, calling 
                        him "Puppy".

                    <p>
                        Meanwhile, Sam and Dean eventually find possible ways 
                        to defeat Amara, using Hands of God, powerful objects 
                        said to contain the power of God himself. Even after 
                        finding one, Sam, Dean, Rowena, and Crowley try to get 
                        Lucifer out of Castiel's body but it fails and he 
                        absorbs the power of the Hand of God and uses it on 
                        Amara, but it fails and he is taken against this will 
                        by Amara. And she starts to torture him to draw out 
                        God. And as fate would have it, eventually, God 
                        himself finally returns. After having a conversation 
                        with Metatron and reconciling with Lucifer, he decides 
                        to help stop her. And though his original plan of 
                        weakening her with Witches, Demons, and Angels and 
                        trying to imprison her again using the Mark fails, 
                        Amara fatally attacks God(Chuck), causing him to start 
                        dying.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although they think Amara seems impossible to destroy, 
                        God tells Sam, Dean, Cass, Crowley, and Rowena that 
                        she does have one weakness: Light with the power of 
                        10,000 suns. So they collect souls to build a bomb. 
                        And Dean is the one to bear it. After talking with 
                        Amara, whom starts to feel bad about attacking and 
                        nearly killing her brother Chuck, Dean convinces her 
                        to forgive him. So she summons him to a garden area 
                        and the two reconcile and decide to go off together 
                        for a while. However, Amara leaves Dean with a thank 
                        you gift and he finds his mother alive and 
                        resurrected. However, in the bunker awaits a British 
                        woman who banishes Cass with a banishing sigil and 
                        shoots Sam, leaving his fate unknown.

                        Dean and Sam are left reeling from the loss of so many 
                        allies and family members and their new responsibility 
                        to 'raise' Jack, with Sam willing to give the boy a 
                        chance while Dean is immediately concerned due to his 
                        heritage. In the other world, Lucifer keeps Mary alive 
                        as a hostage to trade for his son when he returns 
                        home, but finds himself confronted by the alternate 
                        Michael, who has killed his Lucifer and won the war. 
                        Although Dean becomes increasingly bitter at their 
                        recent losses, he gains a new sense of hope when Jack 
                        unintentionally brings Castiel back to life. Things 
                        become complicated when Men of Letters Arthur Ketch is

                        received from Rowena, Ketch taking Castiel and a 
                        weakened Lucifer prisoner after Lucifer escapes back

                        reality.

                        While the Winchesters' efforts to return to the other 
                        world to rescue Mary fail, Ketch is revealed to be 
                        working with Asmodeus, who reveals in turn that the 
                        source of his power is Gabriel, who actually faked his 
                        death during his confrontation with Lucifer but was 
                        sold to Asmodeus by the children of the real Loki. 
                        After their first attempt to enter the other world 
                        traps Jack in that reality, the Winchesters retrieve 
                        the demon tablet, a translation of it reveals the 
                        ingredients needed to open a portal to the other world. 
                        As Jack sides with Mary and the humans against the 
                        angels, the Winchesters and Castiel gather the 
                        ingredients for the spell to open the portal while 
                        Lucifer tries to re-establish himself as king of 
                        Heaven in the absence of God and other archangels. 
                        After Ketch rescues Gabriel, allowing the Winchesters 
                        to use his grace as part of the spell, the initial 
                        raid on the other world fails to achieve more than 
                        Dean rescuing the alternate version of his deceased 
                        friend Charlie Bradbury, but Gabriel flees in fear 
                        after an attack on the bunker by Asmodeus. With Heaven 
                        in desperate straits after Lucifer fails to hold the 
                        angels together, Castiel is charged with finding 
                        Gabriel while the last ten angels try to keep Heaven 
                        in order, leaving the Winchesters to mount a new 
                        assault on the other world with Gabriel and Lucifer. 
                        They are able to rescue a range of human survivors 
                        from the other world, including the alternate versions 
                        of Bobby and Charlie, but Gabriel is killed in the 
                        process and Lucifer and the alternate Michael follow 
                        them through.

                        As Lucifer takes Jack's power for himself, Dean is 
                        forced to make a deal to act as the vessel for the 
                        alternate Michael to stop him. Dean is able to stay in 
                        control long enough to kill Lucifer, but the season 
                        ends with Michael taking control of Dean's body and 
                        departing.

                        Three weeks after Apocalypse World Michael possessed 
                        Dean, the archangel is confronting individuals of every 
                        different species, questioning their wants and 
                        dismissing them as hopeless, until he encounters a 
                        vampire who expresses his desire to eat. Praising his 
                        desire as pure, Michael decides to raise monsters 
                        above mankind and begins experimenting with archangel 
                        grace and monsters, making them immune to their former 
                        weaknesses. Sam, Bobby from Apocalypse World and Mary 
                        track Michael down, and Michael seemingly leaves

                        resistance. Meanwhile, Jack becomes sick due to the 
                        loss of his powers, and dies later, his soul ascending 
                        to Heaven. But the Shadow being from the Empty, 
                        believing Jack's soul belongs to it and irritated with 
                        Castiel for escaping it, attacks Heaven and makes a 
                        deal with Castiel to take the angel in place of Jack,

                        once and for all, but Michael retakes control of Dean 
                        and unleashes his monsters on the city. The group 
                        subdue Michael, and Dean takes back control of his body 
                        and imprisons the archangel in his mind. Dean, with the 
                        help of Billie, builds the Ma'lak Box to imprison 
                        himself in, in order to protect the world from Michael. 
                        But Sam convinces Dean that they'll find another 
                        solution, and Dean makes a wish that brings John 
                        Winchester back from the past for a day. Dean is then 
                        injured on a hunt, and Michael is unleashed. Michael 
                        possesses Rowena temporarily, and kills most of the 
                        Apocalypse World hunters, but Jack burns off his soul 
                        to murder Michael and takes Michael's grace to restore 
                        his powers.

                        Nick, who survived Lucifer's death and suffers 
                        psychological damage from so many years of being 
                        Lucifer's vessel, sets about getting justice for the 
                        deaths of his family. His killing spree leads him to 
                        the prophet Donatello Redfield, and Nick communicates 
                        with the recently awakened Lucifer in the Empty. Nick 
                        tricks Jack into giving him Jack's blood, and tries to 
                        resurrect Lucifer to be his vessel again. Jack 
                        confronts, and then kills Nick in front of Mary. After
                        Mary berates Jack for viciously murdering Nick, the now 
                        soulless Jack kills Mary by accident, leaving the boys 
                        without their mother for a second time. Castiel prays 
                        for God to return and fix Jack, but the angels 
                        manipulate Jack into solidifying their power. Out of 
                        options, Sam and Dean imprison Jack in the Mal'ak Box,
                        but Jack escapes. God returns and tells the boys that 
                        they must use a gun that he built to kill Jack, but 
                        Sam and Dean, frustrated with God's disappearances and 
                        inaction, refuse him.

                        up to see the Shadow and Billie waiting for him in the 
                        Empty. God decides to end the world, and unleashes 
                        every vengeful spirit from Hell back on Earth and sets 
                        an army of corpses upon Sam, Dean and Castiel.
