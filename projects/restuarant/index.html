                    Wrap It Up was an idea our owners grandmother would tell 
                    him on occasion. She had dreams of showing the world what 
                    it meant to grow and cook your own local produce and all 
                    the different and wonderful ways to prepare it! She 
                    lived part of her life very simply, meaning she provided 
                    for herself and others on a community farm and learned 
                    many ways for food preparation. Today her dream has been 
                    realized. We strictly use farm to table business’s and 
                    strive for excellence both in the produce we sell and the 
                    chefs whom we have preparing it for you, the customer!! 
                    We pride ourselves on our down home methods and cannot 
                    wait to show you all of our worldwide methods! We hope 
                    you enjoy his grandmothers cooking as much as he did 
                    as a kid!!
