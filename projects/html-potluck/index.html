            From his hideout beneath a 19th century Paris opera house, the 
            brooding Phantom (Gerard Butler) schemes to get closer to vocalist 
            Christine Daae (Emmy Rossum). The Phantom, wearing a mask to hide 
            a congenital disfigurement, strong-arms management into giving the 
            budding starlet key roles, but Christine instead falls for arts 
            benefactor Raoul (Patrick Wilson). Terrified at the notion of her 
            absence, the Phantom enacts a plan to keep Christine by his side, 
            while Raoul tries to foil the scheme.
